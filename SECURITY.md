# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.

Instead, report them privately by:

1. Opening a GitHub issue with **no sensitive details** and asking for a private contact channel, **or**
2. Contacting the maintainer through the contact method listed on the project’s GitHub profile.

If you're unsure whether something is a security issue, err on the side of reporting it privately.

## What to include
